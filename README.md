# big-data-challenge
Used ZEPL notebooks to ETL two datasets for Amazon reviews. Luggage and watches were analyzed and transformed to fit the given schema file using pyspark. Then the dataframes were loaded into an RDS instance using AWS.
Data Analyzed:
*Luggage: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Luggage_v1_00.tsv.gz
*Watches: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Watches_v1_00.tsv.gz
